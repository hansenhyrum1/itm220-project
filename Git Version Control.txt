How to use GIT version control
Always push your files to your branch, the following commands show how to add all changes to your push and how to send them to GitHub.


git checkout [branch name]
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push

When you log on again and go to pull the changes made, you must move to the main branch to pull the changes.

git checkout main
git pull

Don't forget to change back to your branch to push changes you have made.
